Zynga memcached module for PHP
------------------------------
Added support for memcache connection multiplexer - mcmux

The original PHP memcache module is changed in such a way that if 
mcmux is enabled, instead of directly connecting to the memcache 
server, all memcache connections are proxied through mcmux. 
The client (php memcache module) sends the ip address and port of the 
memcache server along with each request so that mcmux can allot a 
connection from a pool of connections that it maintains per memcache 
server. The protocol between mcmux and the client is a modified version 
of the ascii memcache protocol.

Three new ini settings are added to the memcache module to enable mcmux:

memcache.proxy_enabled = 1/0 - switches proxy support on/off
memcache.proxy_host = hostname_of_mcmux or unix:///path/to/unixsocket
memcache.proxy_port = port_of_mcmux or 0 if unix socket

If proxy support is disabled (proxy_enabled == 0), the module behaves 
exactly same as the OOB php memcache plugin. If it is enabled but if the 
proxy is not reachable, it prints out a warning in the log file and 
returns connection error.

Building:

    Make sure php-devel and php-pear packages are installed
    run ./build-rpm.sh for creating the rpm

memcached module for PHP
------------------------
This module requires zlib library, used for on-the-fly data (de)compression.
Also, you'll need memcached to use it =)

The memcached website is here:

You will probably need libevent to install memcached:
You can download it here: http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
